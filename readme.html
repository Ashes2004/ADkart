## 🛠️ How I Built It

- Installed [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) to run WordPress locally
- Created a custom WordPress theme from scratch
- Fetched data from FakeStore API using JS `fetch()`
- Managed cart with JavaScript + `localStorage`
- Styled using pure CSS (no frameworks yet)
- Created `contact-us.php` and `page-cart.php` as **custom page templates**

---

## 📄 How to Use

1. **Install LocalWP** and create a new WordPress site
2. Copy this theme into `/wp-content/themes/adkart`
3. Go to **WordPress dashboard** → Appearance → Themes → **Activate ADkart**
4. Create pages:
   - **Cart** (select `Cart` template)
   - **Contact Us** (select `Contact Us` template)
5. Visit `http://your-local-site.local/` in your browser
6. Done! 🎉
